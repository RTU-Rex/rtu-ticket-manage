    <input type="checkbox" name="accordeon-title" class="accordeon-checkbox" id="accordeon-title" />
    <label for="accordeon-title" class="accordeon-title-label">My computer does not turn on, what do I do now?</label>
    
    <div class="accordeon-content">
        <p>First check the computer's power cord to make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket. If you are using a plug strip, make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket and that the power switch on the plug strip is turned on. Some plug strips also have a built-in circuit breaker which usually looks like a black or red button near the power switch. Press the button to reset it and see if that solves the problem.</p>

    <label for="accordeon-title2" class="accordeon-title-label">What do I do when my computer crashes?</label>
    
    <div class="accordeon-content">
        <p>There are many reasons why a computer may just stop working or "freeze". Most of the time there isn't much we can do about it; it is a fact of life that computer programs have become so complex that occasionally users will experience problems even when performing common tasks. When your computer no longer responds to keyboard commands your best bet is to restart the computer.</p>

  <label for="accordeon-title7" class="accordeon-title-label">There are black borders on my monitors screen, what do I do?</label>
  <div class="accordeon-content">
    <p>If the resolution was recently changed it is possible for the monitor to not auto adjust or shift to the correct size. If this occurs, the resolution can be changed back to the original setting or you can manually adjust the monitor. If a black border exists on the monitor, it can generally be resolved by manually adjusting the horizontal or vertical width. Because each monitor is different, the method of adjusting this setting will vary; consult your monitor documentation.</p>
